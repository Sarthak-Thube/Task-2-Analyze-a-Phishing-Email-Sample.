## What You'll Learn

  * **Identifying Red Flags**: Through the analysis process, you will learn to recognize the common tell-tale signs and indicators that distinguish a phishing email from legitimate communication. This includes identifying suspicious sender addresses that don't match the purported organization, understanding the manipulative use of urgent or threatening language, and being wary of generic or impersonal greetings.

  * **Header Analysis**: A critical aspect of phishing analysis is the ability to interpret email headers. This repository will teach you how to access and analyze these often-overlooked metadata fields to uncover the email's true origin, including the sending server's IP address and geographical location. Understanding the delivery path can reveal discrepancies and inconsistencies that point to malicious activity.

  * **Link Investigation**: Phishing emails frequently contain deceptive links that redirect victims to malicious websites designed to steal credentials or install malware. You will learn safe methods for examining these suspicious URLs without clicking on them, such as hovering over links to preview the destination and using online link analysis tools to assess their safety.

  * **Threat Intelligence**: By analyzing the phishing sample, you will gain valuable insight into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly employed by attackers. This includes understanding the specific social engineering lures they use, the types of malicious payloads they distribute, and the overall strategies behind their campaigns. This knowledge enhances your ability to proactively identify and mitigate future threats.
